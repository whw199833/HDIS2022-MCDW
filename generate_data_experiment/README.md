This is the `Datasets`, `notebook` and the `result analysis` for the generate_data for 5 confounders/ 9 confounders/ 20 confounders.

## Datasets

The aim of incorporating synthetic data in the simulation process is to be able to provide an priori evidence of individual treatment effects. The generation mechanism is featured by nuisance components  and an easy treatment effect function, available in Causalml, causalml.dataset.simulate_nuisance_and_easy_treatment module. 
Three synthetic datasets are generated with 5, 9 and 20 confounders, respectively. Please navigate to the `Datasets` folder of this repository to obtain the necessary datasets before running the notebooks.
